Example Scenario for Testing Facebook Pixel Integration
The business has requested the implementation of a meta pixel tag across various brands using the provided snippet of code. The relevant Facebook Pixel IDs for each brand are:
⦁	Daily Telegraph: '306782539995622'
⦁	Townsville Bulletin: '22623212840122371'
⦁	Vogue: '2252558014761225278'
⦁	GQ: '2115797005178411225'
The script should only be applied to index and story content pages.
(function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s){
   if (f.fbq) return;
   n = f.fbq = function() {
       n.callMethod ? n.callMethod.apply(n, arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments)
   };
   if (!f._fbq)
       f._fbq = n;
   n.push = n;
   n.loaded = !0;
   n.version = '2.0';
   n.queue = [];
   t = b.createElement(e);
   t.async = !0;
   t.src = v;
   s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
   s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s)
})(window, document, 'script', 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', [ID]);
fbq('track', 'PageView');


The website's data layer variables define the brands and content types as follows:
⦁	Brands: A for Daily Telegraph, B for Townsville Bulletin, C for Vogue, D for GQ
⦁	Content Types: E for index, F for homepage, G for stories

Can you please let us know what are your steps and process on how to solve this request?
